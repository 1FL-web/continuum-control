# Soft Continuum Robot MATLAB Project

## Overview

This MATLAB project focuses on the kinematic and dynamic modeling, as well as control aspects, of a 2-section soft continuum robot with a planar shape. The soft robot is inspired by biological entities like octopus tentacles, snakes, and trunks. The project explores the advantages of using a Planar Constant Curvature (PCC) design over a rigid planar RR (Revolute-Revolute) design, incorporating new degrees of freedom and 3D printed soft materials.

## Project Components

### Kinematics Model (kinematics_model.m):
Define the kinematics model of the 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) continuum section.
Implement the inverse kinematics (IK) for a specific case of a 2-section PCC serial continuum robot in a planar case.
Dynamics Model (dynamics_model.m):
### Develop a closed dynamics model for the 2-section continuum robot.
Utilize the Lagrangian approach for dynamics evaluation, considering conservative elastic forces.
### Stability Analyses (stability_analysis.m):
Perform stability analyses based on the closed dynamics model.
Consider the effects of external forces and their impact on local pose and internal non-conservative forces.
Single Section Dynamics Simulation (single_section_simulation.m):
Simulate the dynamics of a single section of the continuum robot to understand its behavior in isolation.
### Workspace Analyses (workspace_analysis.m):
Analyze the workspace of the continuum robot, comparing the planar PCC configurations with planar RR configurations.
Highlight the 2Ï€ periodicity in the planar RR workspace and the richer set of configurations in the planar PCC workspace.
Control of the Soft Continuum Manipulator (control.m):
Develop control strategies for the soft continuum manipulator based on the obtained models.
Implement control algorithms considering the soft nature of the robot and the energetic considerations.
# Instructions

## Setup:
Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
Download the project files to your local machine.
## Execution:
Run each MATLAB script (.m file) to execute specific components of the project.
Follow the order outlined in the Overview section for a systematic approach.
## Customization:
Modify parameters, initial conditions, or algorithms as needed for your specific application.
Results:
Review the generated plots and output data to gain insights into the kinematics, dynamics, and control aspects of the soft continuum robot.
Documentation:
Refer to the comments within each script for detailed explanations of the code.
Consult the associated research papers or references for in-depth theoretical background.
##Notes
This project assumes a planar configuration for simplicity but can be extended to 3D if needed.
External forces and their effects on the robot's behavior are considered, but further research may be needed for a more accurate representation.
